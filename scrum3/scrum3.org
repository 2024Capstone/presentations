# * Plan for Cultivator Demo
# <2024-01-08 Mon> or <2024-01-15 Mon>
# #+BEGIN_notes
# *Focus on Integration and Testing*
# Over the coming weeks, our team will concentrate on integrating the components we've developed. We'll be rigorously testing the system to ensure stability and performance under different scenarios.

# *User Experience Enhancement*
# Another key area we'll be working on is enhancing the user experience. This includes refining the UI/UX design and improving navigation and accessibility within our application based on user feedback from user testing.

# *Scalability and Security*
# We also plan to assess and enhance the scalability and security aspects of our application, ensuring it can handle increased load and protect user data effectively.
# #+END_notes

#  - /Begin Datalake Integration/: Swap DynamoDB with simplified Datalake
#  - /Comprehensive Testing/: Ensuring system stability and performance
#  - /Enhancing User Experience/: Refining UI/UX and improving navigation and presentation
#  - /Scalability and Security/: Upgrading system to handle increased loads and bolster security
# - /Data Governance Compliance/: Align policies with Client's data governance and compliance policies

# * Plan for Cultivator Demo
# # ** Individual Contributions
# #+BEGIN_notes
# =Adam=
# My primary focus will be on the frontend. I'll be implementing user feedback we've received to improve the interface and overall user journey.
# I will also be working on adding more interactive elements to the application, aiming to create a more engaging and intuitive user experience.

# =Ben=
# I will focus on enhancing the backend infrastructure for better scalability and reliability. This includes optimizing our database interactions and ensuring our server architecture can handle higher loads efficiently.
# Additionally, I'll work on implementing more comprehensive security measures to protect our data and user information.

# =Dan=
# I plan to concentrate on refining the API endpoints for better performance and reliability. This includes optimizing the code and ensuring smooth integration with the frontend.
# I'll also be contributing to our testing efforts, particularly focusing on backend tests to validate our data processing and storage mechanisms.
# #+END_notes

# *Adam*
#  - /Frontend Development/: Incorporate user feedback to improve interface
#  - /Improve & Refactor/: Look to make improvements where necessary in the existing frontend design and code
#  - /New Functionality/: Table pagination, dynamic table updating, table sorting, and feedback to user actions

# *Ben*
#  - /Datalake Infrastructure/: Begin Datalake integration
#  - /Backend Infrastructure/: Enhance scalability and reliability
#  - /Security Measures/: Implement IAMs and Datalake permissions
#  - /Governance/: Requirements gathering and implementation of policies

# *Dan*
#  - /API Optimization/: Refine endpoints for performance
#  - /Backend Testing/: Ensure robust data processing and storage

# * Plan for Cultivator Demo
# # ** Coordination and Goals
# *Coordination and Goals*
# #+BEGIN_notes
# =Team Coordination=: All these efforts will be synchronized regularly through team meetings and collaborative tools to ensure we're aligned and making consistent progress towards our goals.
# *Next Meeting*: By our next meeting, we aim to have made significant progress in these areas, with a focus on presenting a more polished and robust version of our application.
# #+END_notes

#  - /Regular Team Sync/: Ensure alignment and consistent progress
#  - /Regular Client Sync/: Ensure alignment on integration requirements
#  - /Aim for Next Meeting/: Present a new MVP iteration


* Reintroduction
*Project Client:* K + S Potash Canada

*Client Challenge:* Huge amount of data with no means for aggregation, processing, exploration.

*Project Overview:*
The  project aims to address critical challenges and opportunities in data science and data management within the organization.

*Goal:* Improve operational efficiency, data uniformity, and environmental sustainability

*How:* Create a management tool for data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data management

[[../vlog2/logo.svg]]

* Scope
*Creation of:*
- web interface with SSO using Azure AD
  - enter new use cases
  - view existing use cases
  - monitor processing jobs
  - retrieve Power Bi query of processed data

- processing pipeline
- infrastructure on AWS
  - VPC, EC2, S3, Load balancing, Reporting
  - CloudFormation, ECS, ECR, SQS, SageMaker
  - DataLake (currently using DynamoDB)

- IAM Permission setup
- CI/CD utilizing Localstack (both locally and in the cloud)
- CI/CD utilizing AWS Services

#+BEGIN_notes
VPC - Virtual Private Cloud handles deployment/isolation of services across a network

EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud scalable virtual machine service

S3 - Simple Storage Service is object storage/datalake backend

Load Balancing - distribute multiple containers and balance traffic between them

CloudFormation - deployment of AWS resources

ECS - Elastic Container Service to deploy, manage, scale containers

ECR - Elastic Container Registry is basically a repo for Docker/OCI images

SQS - Simple Queue Service is a queue service

SageMaker - ML environment with Notebooks (jupyter, etc.)

# At this stage, the project is progressing but at a slightly reduced rate.

*Reasons for Status:*
# -

*Planned Actions:*
- continue development of /MVP2/
- revisit goals with Client to align with their new strategic roadmap


* Progress
*Ben:*
- infrastructure as code development
- optimized artifact caching -> 50% reduction in deploy time
- upgraded CI/CD to Localstack 3
- determining design patterns for processing framework

*Daniil:*
- business logic and infra to handle multiple analysis types
- use case endpoint creation
- endpoint URL deployment
- additional DynamoDB tables

*Adam:*
- responsive navbar
