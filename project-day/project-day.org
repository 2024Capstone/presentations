* Project Introduction
*Project Client:* K + S Potash Canada

*Client Challenge:* Huge amount of data with no means for aggregation, processing, exploration. Currently lots of data is transferred around in bulky Excel spreadsheets.

*Project Overview:*
VisiLake aims to address critical challenges and opportunities in data science and data management within the organization.

*Goal:* Improve operational efficiency, data uniformity, and environmental sustainability

*How:* Create a management tool for data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data management

* What is a Data Lake?

- *Data Repository:* A data lake is like a big pond where all types of data—structured, semi-structured, and unstructured—are stored in their raw form.

- *Flexible Storage:* Unlike traditional databases, data lakes can handle various data formats without needing predefined schemas, making them versatile and adaptable.

- *Scalability:* Think of a data lake as a reservoir that can grow infinitely, allowing organizations to store and manage vast amounts of data as their needs expand.

- *Analytics Hub:* Data lakes serve as a hub for advanced analytics, providing a rich source of data for machine learning, AI, and other analytics tools to extract valuable insights.
