* Scope
*Creation of:*
- web interface with SSO using Azure AD
  - enter new use cases
  - view existing use cases
  - monitor processing jobs
  - retrieve Power Bi query of processed data

- processing pipeline
- infrastructure on AWS
  - VPC, EC2, S3, Load balancing, Reporting
  - CloudFormation, ECS, ECR, SQS, SageMaker
  - DataLake (currently using DynamoDB)

- IAM Permission setup
- CI/CD utilizing Localstack (both locally and in the cloud)
- CI/CD utilizing AWS Services

#+BEGIN_notes
VPC - Virtual Private Cloud handles deployment/isolation of services across a network

EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud scalable virtual machine service

S3 - Simple Storage Service is object storage/datalake backend

Load Balancing - distribute multiple containers and balance traffic between them

CloudFormation - deployment of AWS resources

ECS - Elastic Container Service to deploy, manage, scale containers

ECR - Elastic Container Registry is basically a repo for Docker/OCI images

- significant progress on web-app completed
#TODO DAN

*Planned Actions:*
- complete development of /MVP2/
- revisit goals with Client to align with their new strategic roadmap
#TODO DAN


* Progress
*Ben:*
- IAC templates for data lake deployment on AWS completed
- testing deployment of data lake
  - /S3/, /Elastic Search/, /Athena/, /Glue/

*Daniil:*
#TODO DAN
- ...

*Adam:*
- Frontend Design & Implementation of Use Case table pagination
- Minor improvements to responsiveness of the application


* Issues
- significant issues have yet to be identified at this stage
- a thorough evaluation of IAM permissions must be done before deployment to AWS
  - localstack has numerous problems handling IAM


* Scope Changes
- data lake design and deployment
  - new documentation required
  - updates to architecture diagram


* Next Up
*Ben:*
- continue with data lake deployment and testing
- limitations of Localstack wrt/ data lake
- data lake infrastructure doc creation
- path forward to migrate to /Lake Formation/

*Daniil:*
#TODO DAN
- ...

*Adam:*
