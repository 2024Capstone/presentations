* Reintroduction
*Project Client:* K + S Potash Canada

*Client Challenge:* Huge amount of data with no means for aggregation, processing, exploration.

*Project Overview:*
The  project aims to address critical challenges and opportunities in data science and data management within the organization.

*Goal:* Improve operational efficiency, data uniformity, and environmental sustainability

*How:* Create a management tool for data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data management

# * Scope
# *Creation of:*
# - web interface with SSO using Azure AD
#   - enter new use cases
#   - view existing use cases
#   - monitor processing jobs
#   - retrieve Power Bi query of processed data

# - processing pipeline
# - infrastructure on AWS
#   - VPC, EC2, S3, Load balancing, Reporting
#   - CloudFormation, ECS, ECR, SQS, SageMaker
#   - DataLake (currently using DynamoDB)

# - IAM Permission setup
# - CI/CD utilizing Localstack (both locally and in the cloud)
# - CI/CD utilizing AWS Services

# #+BEGIN_notes
# VPC - Virtual Private Cloud handles deployment/isolation of services across a network

# EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud scalable virtual machine service

# S3 - Simple Storage Service is object storage/datalake backend

# Load Balancing - distribute multiple containers and balance traffic between them

# CloudFormation - deployment of AWS resources

# ECS - Elastic Container Service to deploy, manage, scale containers

# ECR - Elastic Container Registry is basically a repo for Docker/OCI images

# SQS - Simple Queue Service is a queue service

# SageMaker - ML environment with Notebooks (jupyter, etc.)
# #+END_notes

# * Scope Changes
# - data lake design and deployment
#   - new documentation required
#   - updates to architecture diagram
