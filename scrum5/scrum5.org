*Daniil:*
#TODO DAN

*Adam:*
- Improved search feature to search across multiple columns
- Implemented & Tested UI components & functionality for sorting and filtering columns


* User Testing
- Conducted two user testing sessions
- Problematic Features:
  - File tag form field was a bit confusing
  - 'Copy PowerBI Link' Button was confusing
  - 'Submit Use Case' Button lacked 'feedback'
  - Found a minor bug with pagination buttons
- Suggestions:
  - One user recommeneded we add a date range for the data being processed
- Overall:
  - Both users found that the website was easy and simple to use
  - Users were interested in testing the application again once we have data being processed
  - Users were able to understand the purpose of the application and how to use it, with very little assistance


* Changes
- Named our application: 'VisiLake'
  - Project Day Title: 'VisiLake: Self-Service Data Lake Exploration & Analysis on AWS'


* Next Up
Next round of user testing scheduled for weeks 7/8

*Ben:*
- Transition CloudFormation -> Terraform
- Simplify DL stack
- test DL ingestion
- Deploy Athena to enable querying DL

*Daniil:*
#TODO DAN

*Adam:*
- Make UI modifications/improvements based on user testing results & feedback
- Align UI design with K+S Corporate Design Manual
- Improve responsiveness of use case table page


* Team Reflection
*On Status:* =Green=

*Progress to Feel Good About:*
- Received lots of great feedback from user testing
- Data lake coming together
