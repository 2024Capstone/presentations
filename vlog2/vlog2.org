* The Project
#+BEGIN_notes
#+END_notes

*Client:* K+S Potash Canada, a potash solution mine just north of Regina, SK

*Project Overview:* The  project aims to address critical challenges and opportunities that come with having an huge amount of data without any process of managing it.

*Primary Focus:* Provide a self-serve application to query a data lake and do simple analysis. Deployed across AWS services (EC2, ECS/ECR, SQS, Datalake).

*Why:* Operational Excellence project to discover ways to analyze data leading to decreased raw water consumption and increased operational efficiency.


* Activities
#+BEGIN_notes
*Ben*
- Focused on laying the foundation for our project's backend and infrastructure. Initiating the infrastructure and integrating DynamoDB and SQS into our stack were some of my key contributions. These elements were crucial in setting up a robust and scalable backend.
- My work on integrating the localstack-pro image and updating Docker images was aimed at ensuring operational efficiency and reliability. These efforts were vital for maintaining the smooth running of our application.
- Throughout the project, I was actively involved in backend development, ensuring that our application has a strong and stable foundation.
- Optimizing our infrastructure and backend processes, which has been essential in bringing our project to its current state of advanced functionality.

*Adam*
- Focused on developing the frontend and user interface. Connecting the frontend to various endpoints was a significant part of my work, ensuring that our users have a seamless experience when interacting with our application."
- I focused on enhancing user experience, evident in my work on updating the form page to support the chaining of analysis types. This feature was intended to improve the usability and analytical capabilities of our application.
- Contributing to the 'view use cases' page was a major milestone. This feature not only added a critical component to our application but also allowed me to demonstrate my ability to oversee a feature from its inception to successful integration.
- Geared towards refining the frontend, improving the overall user experience, and making our application visually appealing and user-friendly.

*Dan*
- Focused on backend development, especially in creating and managing API endpoints. These endpoints are fundamental to our applicationâ€™s functionality, handling data processing and user interactions efficiently.
- Added various endpoints, including those for use-case submission, analysis types, and tag validation. My aim was to ensure robust data handling and integrity for the application.
- One of my key contributions was connecting the submit form to the queue and managing database connections. This aspect of my work highlights my focus on data integrity and efficient backend handling.
- Strengthening the backend, making it capable of handling complex tasks and user requests effectively.

*Focus on Integration and Testing*
Over the coming weeks, our team will concentrate on integrating the components we've developed. We'll be rigorously testing the system to ensure stability and performance under different scenarios.

*User Experience Enhancement*
Another key area we'll be working on is enhancing the user experience. This includes refining the UI/UX design and improving navigation and accessibility within our application based on user feedback from user testing.

*Scalability and Security*
We also plan to assess and enhance the scalability and security aspects of our application, ensuring it can handle increased load and protect user data effectively.
